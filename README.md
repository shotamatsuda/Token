## Compiling

Install the following dependencies via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh),

- boost (developed on 1.63.0)
- libplist (developed on 1.12)

and run [skia.sh](script/skia.sh) inside the [script folder](script) in this repository to download and build Skia (this will take a time to complete since it's a large piece of source codes).

After making sure to init and update the submodules, you should be able to open the project file in Xcode and build it.
